# REAL TIME CHAT APP WITH NODE.JS AND SOCKET.IO

Our aim is to create a real time chat application complete with usernames and connect/disconnect messages. We will use Socket.io to manage real time web socket connections to a Node.js server that will allow you to communicate real time chat messages to all clients connected to a single server.

This entire project will take less than 100 lines of JavaScript and almost no HTML/CSS, but it is incredibly powerful what can be done with such little code.
